# Qt - Ogre

A sample code of the interfacing of Qt and Ogre under Windows.
An ogre scene is rendered in a QWidget of a Qt Application.
It is the kind of code I use to create the editors for my game Afro-Rangers.

## Dependencies
- Qt 5.x.x
- Ogre 1.9.x
- CMake 3.x.x

## Installation
Call CMake on the root CMakeLists, providing the path to Qt5 and Ogre.
Then call:

make install
make deploy-qt
